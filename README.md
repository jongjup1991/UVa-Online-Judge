# UVa-Online-Judge
Problems on the Uva Online Judge platform, and my solutions to them, verified to be correct.

You will see .pdf files in the format ^[0-9]+\\.pdf$, and source code files in the format ^problemid\\_[0-9]+\\.[A-Za-z]+$, where the number n in the pdf file name uniquely identifies the problem in the UVa database, and the corresponding problemid_n.whatever is the solution. As an example, for problem #15 in the system, the statement and description can be found in 15.pdf, for which my solution can be found in problemid_15.whatever.
